# Employee-Tracker

## Description

This is an employee tracker that allows the user to add departments, employees, and roles. It also allows the user to view all departments, roles, and employees. This application also allows you to update a specific employee's role.  This uses Node.js and MySQL so if you want to use this first clone the repo then make sure that you have Node.js and MySQL installed along with any other package you see that are required at the top of the index.js file.
